1. what is reference variable: 
shortcut or a second name for the same memory location. This is useful in functions to avoid copying large amounts of data and to directly modify the original data


2. creating reference variable: 

int i = 25 ;
    int& j = i;
    cout<<i<<endl;
    cout<<j<<endl;
    i++;
    cout<<i<<endl; //26
    j++;
    cout<<j<<endl; //27
    


3. why reference variable needed?
 it works on call by reference : without creating new memory it created new variable

void update(int& n){
    n++;
    cout<<"After execution of call by reference: "<<n<<endl;
}

NOTE : CALL BY VALUE JUST create new memory and copied the contains*/
