SOme key points for pointers

1. pointer stores address with the help of & adrdress of.

2. NOTE : *ptr : value at pointer and ptr gives value's address.


3: creatig pointer : ptr is a pointer to int

4: size of pointer : pointer size is always 8 which stores address only irrespective of data type. excpeth integer which is 4.


5. int = 5;
int *p = &i;

or another way

int *p = 0 : null pointer
p = &i;
 

6. note (*p)++ does not work with cout we need to write it separately

7. copying value of one pointer into another

inside main : 
int i = 25;
int *p = 0 ;
p = &i;
 cout<<"Pointer address : "<<p<<endl;
 cout<<"print num using pointer: "<<*p<<endl;
cout<<"Before increment: "<<i<<endl;
*p = *p+2; 
cout<<"After increment: "<<i<<endl;

 copying a pointer
int *q = p ;
cout<<p<<" = "<<q<<endl;
cout<<*p<<" = "<<*q<<endl;

//8. important concept:
int *t = &i;
*t = *t+1;
cout<<*t<<endl;
cout<<"Before t: "<<t<<endl;
t = t+1 ;
cout<<"After t: "<<t<<endl; //4 bytes age
